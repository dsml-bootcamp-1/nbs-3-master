    "- An API key from OpenWeatherMap.\n",
    "- Python's `requests` library installed. (Install via `pip install requests` if needed.)\n",

    "   - Register for an account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).\n",
    "   - Obtain your free API key (note that there might be an activation delay).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Python Script for Weather Data Retrieval**:\n",
    "   - The script uses the `requests` library to make an API call.\n",
    "   - Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n",
    "   - Replace `'CITY_NAME'` with your desired city name."

    "#### Challenge: Analyzing Instagram Hashtag Trends with Instaloader\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Leverage `Instaloader`, a Python library, to download posts associated with a specific hashtag on Instagram. Analyze the collected data to identify trends, popular content, and user engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Install Instaloader\n",
    "- Ensure Python is installed on your system.\n",
    "- Install `Instaloader` using pip: `pip install instaloader`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Collection\n",
    "- Choose a hashtag relevant to a topic of interest (e.g., #nature, #travel, #food).\n",
    "- Use `Instaloader` to download posts tagged with the chosen hashtag. Consider limitations like the number of posts to avoid overwhelming the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import instaloader\n",
    "\n",
    "L = instaloader.Instaloader()\n",
    "posts = instaloader.Hashtag.from_name(L.context, 'YOUR_HASHTAG').get_posts()\n",
    "\n",
    "for post in posts:\n",
    "    # Add code to process and store post details\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 3. Data Analysis\n",
    "Analyze the downloaded data for:\n",
    "- Popular trends in the hashtag.\n",
    "- Common themes or subjects in images or captions.\n",
    "- Levels of user engagement (likes, comments).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Reporting\n",
    "- Compile your findings into a report.\n",
    "- Include visual representations (graphs, word clouds) to illustrate key trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes\n",
    "- Respect Instagram's terms of service and ethical guidelines in data scraping.\n",
    "- Be mindful of privacy and consent, especially with user-generated content.\n",
    "- The scope of data collection should be limited for educational purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcome\n",
    "This challenge aims to provide practical experience with Instaloader, develop data analysis skills, and offer insights into social media trends and user behavior."
